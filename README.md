# TimeZoneCalculater
This Java program calculates the destination's time from the origin's time.
To run TimeZoneCalculator.java, TimeZoneList.txt, AND TreeNode.java are required. Please make sure you have them and TimeZoneCalculator.java.

## Mention
- I do want to mention that my professor, Dr. Adrian Veliz, wrote other files besides README.md, TimeZone.txt, TimeZoneCalculator.java, TreeNode.java, and TimeZoneCalculatorUML.txt.
- These entire programs were written as a final project of the CS 143 class.

## About Editing TimeZone List(TimeZoneList.txt)
This repo includes a text file named TimeZoneList.txt. The file has the Region name(Asia, Europe, United States, etc.) and the UTC offset of each city.
If you add city(ies), please follow the rules below. 
- Add city and UTC offset in the appropriate section. (Ex. If you want to add New York, it should be @United States section)
- Write the city name first, then write UTC offset on the SAME LINE. 
- There should be one space between the city name and UTC offset.
- If UTC offset is positive, DO NOT write +(plus). Please write -(negative) if it is negative.
- UTC offset must have at least one demical place.

## Future Plan
This program cannot cope with Summer Time(Daylight Saving Time). Please wait until I update this program.
