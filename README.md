# TimeZoneCalculater
This Java program calculates destination's time from origin's time.
To run TimeZoneCalculator.java, TimeZoneList.txt AND TreeNode.java are required. Please make sure you have them and TimeZoneCalculator.java.

## Note
- I do mention that other files than README.md, TimeZone.txt, TimeZoneCalculator.java, TreeNode.java, and TimeZoneCalculatorUML.txt were written by my professor, Dr. Adrian Veliz.
- These entire programs were written as final project of CS 143 class.

## About Editing TimeZone List(TimeZoneList.txt)
This repo includes txt file which name is TimeZoneList.txt. The file has Region name(Asia, Europe, United States etc.), and UTC offset of each city.
If you add city(ies), please follow rules below. 
- Add city and UTC offset in appropriate section. (Ex. If you want to add New York, it should be @United States section)
- Write city name first, then write UTC offset on the SAME LINE. 
- There should be one space between city name and UTC offset.
- If UTC offset is positive, DO NOT write +(plus). Please write -(negative) if it is negative.
- UTC offset must have at least one demical place.

## Future Plan
This program cannot cope with Summer Time(Daylight Saving Time). Please wait until I update this program.
